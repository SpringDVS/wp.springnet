### Version 0.3.0 ###

This release allows the plugin to handle the updated protocol for multi-part responses. The multi-part responses provide a consistent structuring rule for transmitting and receiving information from multiple nodes with the potential of streaming that information in chunks. The protocol update is a breaking change to previous versions of the plugin.

Also included is a small network topology widget which uses HTML5 canvas to display a network graph. A critical bug fix made to the Explorer widget which made it unworkable unless it was loaded with the bulletin widget.
