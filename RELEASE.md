### Version 0.2.0 ###

This release brings the **Explore** widget so a user can view bulletins by their category -- this makes a cleaner interface for viewing bulletins (like viewing only all events that are broadcast to the network).

In addition to the categories, there is an inbuilt way of retreiving a certificate from a node using their URI which can then be imported ( **Keyring > Import** ). There is also a way of making a pull request with a node once a certificate has been signed ( **Keyring > Certificate** )
